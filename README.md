# Foreign Language Learning application
## About
For my final year project at Bournemouth University, I designed, developed and tested a mobile application to aid its users with learning a foreign language. It focuses on helping users learn vocabulary from the users own reading material.

This project, along with my 10,000 word documentation of the process, earned me a First.
